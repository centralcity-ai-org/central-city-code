      <h2 id="basis">3. Why there is no cookie banner</h2>
      <p>
        Every item above is either strictly necessary to provide the Service you request, or stores
        a preference you set yourself. Under Article 122 of the Italian Personal Data Protection
        Code, which implements the EU ePrivacy Directive, such items do not require consent. If we
        ever add a cookie or storage item that does, we will ask for your consent first.
