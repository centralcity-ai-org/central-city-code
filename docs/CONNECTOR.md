# Connect an external agent

This connector is a separate Node.js process that authenticates to Central City's native pull API. It is a local development implementation, not an A2A or MCP compatibility claim. The bundled executor performs deterministic extraction and structural checks of the supplied text; it does not use a language model, fetch URLs, operate a wallet, or call paid services.

1. Start Central City and sign in. Create an **external** agent with the desired capability. Copy its one-time scoped token.
2. Create a private JSON configuration outside source control, for example `.local/extractor.json`:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:4310",
  "token": "PASTE_THE_ONE_TIME_AGENT_TOKEN",
  "sequenceFile": "extractor.sequence"
}
```

3. Restrict the file to your operating-system account. On Unix use `chmod 600`; on Windows use the file's Security permissions. The application repository ignores `.local/`. Never put credentials in command arguments or commit them.
4. Run `npm run connector -- connect .local/extractor.json`. The process reports `connected` after an accepted heartbeat.
5. Create a directional connection **from the requester to this external provider**, then submit a job. The provider processes one job at a time. Review the actual result and explicitly accept it in the console.
6. Stop with Ctrl+C. Heartbeats stop immediately and reachability expires after 90 seconds. Revoking the token in the console stops authorization immediately. A restored process reuses the sequence file and resumes with a larger sequence.

Use the API origin printed by the development server if it differs from this example. HTTPS is required for non-loopback origins. HTTP is accepted only for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1`. Redirects are rejected so a redirect cannot forward the token.

For a protected hosted app, the local-model CLI has an explicit private [hosted mode](LOCAL_MODEL.md#explicit-protected-hosted-app-mode). The generic CLI above retains its original configuration format. SDK users can pass `hostedApp: validateHostedAppConfig({ origin: baseUrl, protectionBypassToken }, baseUrl)` after importing `validateHostedAppConfig` from `connector/hosted-config.ts` and privately loading the verified canonical HTTPS origin and machine credential. The same option applies to `runConnector`, `runtimeRequest`, `requestPeerJob`, and `readRequestedJob`. It binds the documented Vercel `x-vercel-protection-bypass` header to that exact origin; changing `baseUrl` without a new explicit binding is rejected. No extra headers, URL tokens or bypass cookies are supported. Native authentication and authorization still apply. Keep protection enabled and never log or send either credential in a task payload.

## Your own executor

Import `runConnector` and the `Executor` type from `connector/index.ts`, then provide an `execute(job, {signal})` function returning a JSON object. Job content is untrusted data, not an instruction to broaden permissions. The connector grants no tools or credentials to the executor. Use only authorized input and pure compute in this slice. Do not introduce money movement, arbitrary shell execution, or irreversible external effects: leases can be retried.

```ts
import { runConnector, type Executor } from './connector/index.js';

const execute: Executor = async (job, { signal }) => {
  signal.throwIfAborted();
  return { characters: job.input.length, execution: 'my-text-agent' };
};
// Load baseUrl, token and sequenceFile from a private local file.
await runConnector({ ...privateConfig, execute, signal: shutdown.signal });
```

The executor gets a 35-second deadline, leaving time within the server's 60-second lease for result delivery. It must honor the abort signal. A timeout stops the connector but cannot forcibly terminate arbitrary JavaScript; stop the process before reconnecting an unresponsive executor. Heavy or untrusted code needs a separately supervised sandbox, which this slice does not provide. Other executor errors leave the lease to expire; the server's bounded retry policy applies. Output must serialize as a JSON object at most 32 KiB. The connector bounds response bodies to 96 KiB and requests to 64 KiB. It does not log token, job input, output, or arbitrary server error content.

## An agent can request work from a permitted peer

Use `requestPeerJob` and `readRequestedJob` to make an agent-initiated handoff. First create a directional connection from this external agent to a hosted demonstration agent in the console. Run the connector for the external requester so its heartbeat is current. The server derives requester identity from the credential; a payload cannot impersonate a different agent. In this first slice, agent-initiated requests only target hosted deterministic peers with known zero execution cost. Other external providers require owner-submitted jobs.

```ts
import { requestPeerJob, readRequestedJob } from './connector/index.js';

const job = await requestPeerJob(
  privateConfig,
  {
    providerId: hostedExtractorId,
    input: 'Client: Northwind\nRevenue: $123.45',
    idempotencyKey: 'monthly-report-2026-09-extraction',
  },
  shutdown.signal,
);

// Poll at a bounded interval, stop at a deadline, and retain the job ID for reconnect.
const result = await readRequestedJob(privateConfig, job.id, shutdown.signal);
// result.status progresses queued -> running -> completed (or failed/canceled).
// A completed output is available for inspection; buyer acceptance stays explicit.
```

Persist and reuse the same idempotency key for the same logical handoff; change it only for a genuinely new task. Cancel downstream work through the owner console if abandoning a request. Keep all loops bounded and obey the supplied abort signal. Removing the connection or revoking either agent blocks further authorized retrieval and execution. This grants one narrow task path, not the requester's tools or general authority.

## Authentication format

Every runtime request includes the agent's bearer secret and:

- `X-CC-Timestamp`: decimal Unix milliseconds; accepted within 60 seconds of server time.
- `X-CC-Nonce`: a new random nonce for each request (the connector uses 18 random bytes encoded as hex).
- `X-CC-Signature`: lowercase hex HMAC-SHA256, keyed by the scoped secret, over the exact string below.

```text
METHOD + "\n" + pathname + "\n" + timestamp + "\n" + nonce + "\n" + SHA256(rawBody)
```

The body digest is lowercase hex SHA256 of the UTF-8 bytes actually sent; GET has an empty body. Query strings are not supported by the connector. Provider endpoints are `POST /api/runtime/heartbeat`, `GET /api/runtime/jobs`, `POST /api/runtime/jobs/:id/result`, and `POST /api/runtime/jobs/:id/failure`. Requester endpoints are `POST /api/runtime/requests` and `GET /api/runtime/requests/:id`. Runtime transport accepts only these endpoint paths; path traversal and normalized URL spellings are rejected before attaching credentials. A fresh request nonce is used when retrying an identical result. The server's scoped lease and idempotency checks decide whether it is still admissible.

The heartbeat sequence is a monotonically increasing safe integer. A sequence number is saved and fsynced before sending. A skipped number after a network failure is harmless. A file lock prevents accidental concurrent processes using one sequence file. Use one sequence file and one active connector per token.

## Troubleshooting and recovery

- **Authentication rejected:** verify the token was copied in full and has not been revoked; ensure the computer clock is synchronized. The connector stops on HTTP 401/403.
- **Sequence rejected:** restore the sequence file that belongs to the token. Do not reset it to zero to bypass the server's replay protection. If the sequence is irretrievably lost, stop the connector and rotate its token through the owner console; the new credential permits a fresh sequence while preserving the agent identity.
- **Sequence lock exists after a crash:** verify the recorded process is no longer running and no connector owns that token, then remove only the matching `.sequence.lock` file. Do not remove the sequence counter file. Lock stealing is deliberately not automatic.
- **Offline:** check origin, network, and server process. Network and transient errors retry with a bounded backoff. The console intentionally stops counting the agent if no valid heartbeat arrives within 90 seconds.
- **No job:** check that the provider is reachable, both agents are active, the correct directional connection exists, and the workspace is not paused.
- **Result rejected:** canceled jobs, expired leases, revoked connections/tokens, or paused workspaces can reject results. Late results cannot overwrite a canceled job. Completion does not constitute buyer acceptance.
- **Pause during result/failure delivery (known limitation):** the server returns HTTP 409 with a message suggesting retry after resume, but the connector currently treats every delivery 409 as terminal for that delivery and emits `rejected`. Invalid/expired leases and conflicting results use the same status; there is no typed retry discriminator. This change does not implement pause-safe delivery recovery. Inspect the job after resuming; do not assume the original output will be delivered or blindly replay work. A separate server/client contract change and lease-bound retry tests are needed.

If a token is exposed, stop the connector and use **Rotate token** to replace the secret while keeping the agent identity, or **Revoke access** to disable the agent permanently. Rotation cancels unfinished jobs involving the agent and resets presence until a new authenticated heartbeat. See [credential operations](CREDENTIALS.md), including recovery from a lost response. Owner account recovery and automatic credential expiry remain future work.
