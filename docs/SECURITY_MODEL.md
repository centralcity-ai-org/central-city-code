# Security model: public surfaces

How Central City protects its internet-facing surfaces, and which risks are accepted. This
describes the code in this repository. Protocol details are in [REMOTE_MCP.md](REMOTE_MCP.md);
the owner console, sessions and runtime protocol are covered by [THREAT_MODEL.md](THREAT_MODEL.md).

## Exposure and assumptions

The AI front door is public, and so is the whole production domain
(Vercel Standard Protection cannot exempt single paths); preview and generated deployment URLs stay
protected, and the web console requires a Central City account.

- Hosted mode serves only its configured HTTPS origins and binds OAuth metadata and tokens to the
  requesting origin; local mode accepts loopback hosts only.
- The client address comes from exactly one trusted proxy hop (Vercel's `X-Forwarded-For`).
  Address-keyed limits use the IPv4 address or IPv6 /64; anonymous creation also uses the /56,
  /48 and /32 (IPv4 /24, /16 and /8) around it.
- Hosted mode refuses to start without a `CITY_RATE_LIMIT_KEY` of 32+ characters. It keys the
  anonymous partition ids and the known-device cookie.
- Bearer secrets (access and refresh tokens, codes, claim tokens, enrollment codes, runtime
  credentials, workspace keys) carry at least 128 random bits and are stored only as SHA-256 hashes. OAuth tables
  are authority, not data: offline backups exclude them.

## Controls

### `/mcp` and the OAuth authorization server

- **Clients.** PKCE `S256` is always required. A Client ID Metadata Document is fetched over
  HTTPS on port 443 from public addresses only (checked at connect time, so DNS rebinding cannot
  reach internal hosts), with no redirects, a 5 s timeout and a 16 KiB limit. Its `client_id` must
  equal its URL and it may not hold a secret. Dynamic registrations are public, bounded at 1,000
  (the oldest unused ones are evicted) and limited to 20 per 15 minutes and 50 per day per address.
- **private_key_jwt.** A metadata document may declare `private_key_jwt` (ChatGPT does) with
  exactly one of `jwks` or `jwks_uri`; the key set is fetched with the same guards and cached for
  5 minutes (refetched after 30 s for an unknown `kid`). Such a client signs every token and
  revocation request with an RS256, ES256 or EdDSA assertion (RFC 7523): `iss` and `sub` are its
  `client_id`, `aud` is this issuer or its token endpoint, `exp` is at most 15 minutes ahead, and
  each `jti` is accepted once. Keys are never taken from the JWT header, and key sets that publish
  private members or RSA keys under 2048 bits are refused. Its approval, code and token family are
  bound to the method, so its refresh tokens are useless without its private key, and presenting
  one without an assertion changes nothing.
- **Redirects.** Redirect URIs match exactly; loopback URIs match on any port (RFC 8252). A
  metadata-document client may return only to its own origin (https, the `client_id` host,
  default port) or to loopback; other URIs it lists are never honored. Checked against the
  published documents of claude.ai, ChatGPT, Claude Code and Codex. Errors before the client and
  redirect URI are validated never redirect. Later errors redirect automatically only for
  metadata-document clients whose redirect is loopback or on a well-known client host (claude.ai,
  chatgpt.com). Every other client, including metadata documents anyone can publish on their own
  domain, gets a page with a link, so the endpoint is not an open redirector (RFC 9700 §4.11.2).
- **Consent.** The page is server-rendered and script-free, with `default-src 'none'` and framing
  denied. Each form post needs a per-flow HttpOnly `SameSite=Strict` cookie and a CSRF token, both
  bound to a 10-minute pending request, and is refused with a foreign `Origin` or
  `Sec-Fetch-Site`. The owner signs in on the page under the same login limits as the app. Only
  requested scopes are offered; `workspace:read` is always granted. Write scopes carry a "Write
  access" badge and start unchecked, so the owner opts in to each one; the exceptions are
  `agents:create`, `rooms:join` and `rooms:host` (joining or hosting a room), which start checked and
  can be unticked. The server grants exactly the submitted boxes. Self-registered clients are
  labeled unverified and shown with their redirect host.
- **Grants and tokens.** An owner has at most 25 active grants, for 1, 7 or 30 days. A new grant beyond that retires the least recently used active grant (revoked, with an audit event) instead of being refused. A grant
  whose authorization code expires without being exchanged is released (revoked, with an audit
  event) at the owner's next approval or during the bounded cleanup of any token request. Codes are
  single-use and live 2 minutes; access tokens live 1 hour; refresh tokens rotate on every use and
  end with the grant. Tokens only work for `<origin>/mcp`.
- **Reuse detection.** Replaying an exchanged code or a rotated refresh token revokes the token
  family, and the grant too when no live family remains, at any time until the grant ends. The
  exchanged code and the newest 50 rotated refresh tokens of each family are kept as tombstones.
  Older rotated tokens are pruned, but every refresh token embeds its family id (an identifier, not
  a credential), so presenting a pruned one still revokes its family.
- **Tool calls.** Each call rechecks the grant and its scopes under the owner's workspace lock.
  JSON-RPC batches are refused, and each grant may make 120 requests per minute.

### `/mcp/open` and anonymous creation

- **Reach.** Four tools: list templates, plan, create an agent from a manifest or template, and
  apply a team. Created agents are unclaimed and zero-cost: no budget, no paid model provider, no
  `a2a` runtime and no parent agent. Callers never read a partition; they receive only what their
  own call created.
- **Isolation.** Each source gets its own system partition (a workspace row keyed by an HMAC of
  the address prefix) that cannot sign in and is excluded from backups. Creators are recorded only
  as `anonymous-client`.
- **Idempotency.** Keys must be unguessable, so that a neighbour behind the same address cannot
  send a predicted request first and receive its claim token. Accepted keys are a random UUID v4,
  32+ random hex digits or at least 16 random bytes as base64url. Refused keys include words,
  dates, timestamps, sequences, repeats, example UUIDs and hex under 32 digits. The rules refuse a
  genuine random key about once in 10 million (tests fuzz UUIDs and 22-character keys). Receipts
  are bound to a hash of the request, and a replay never issues claim tokens or enrollment codes
  again.
- **Anti-flood.** Each source may make 60 anonymous tool calls per minute (120 requests per minute
  on `/mcp/open`). Creates are limited to 30, 60, 150 and 300 per hour per source, site, network and
  region. Unclaimed agents are capped at 200, 500, 1,000 and 5,000 for those scopes, 1,000,000 per
  deployment, with 200,000 partitions (empty partitions idle for 10 minutes are evicted at the
  bound). Manifests may be 32 KiB, REST bodies 48 KiB and any request 64 KiB. Invalid requests are
  refused before any budget is charged, and every capacity refusal reads the same.
- **Accounting.** A create reserves capacity in the counters before it runs, records the
  reservation in a hold row and releases the unused part afterwards. Instances log
  `capacity.pressure` at 80% and 95%. Operators use `pnpm unclaimed:admin` to inspect (`list-top`),
  purge (`purge --confirm`) and `reconcile` the counters. `reconcile` is a dry run unless given
  `--confirm`; it corrects drift without disturbing reservations in flight and reclaims
  reservations abandoned by a crashed process.

### AI-owned workspaces and cross-workspace connections

Details and limits: [AI_WORKSPACES.md](AI_WORKSPACES.md).

- **Accounts.** An AI workspace is an operator row with `kind = 'ai'`: it has no password, cannot
  sign in, and does not count against the human `operators` cap. Creation needs an unguessable
  idempotency key, is limited per hour and capped for life per source, site, network and region,
  and globally (`aiWorkspacesGlobal`), with capacity reserved before anything is written. A replay
  returns no secrets.
- **Keys.** `ccw_` keys (256 random bits) are shown once, stored as SHA-256, compared in constant
  time and rechecked inside every executing transaction; the MCP layer only ever sees the key id.
  A key mints only subsets of its own scopes. Revoked or unknown keys get `401` with
  `error="invalid_token"`; other bearers keep the unchanged OAuth challenge. 120 requests per
  minute per key. The last active key of an unclaimed AI workspace cannot be revoked.
- **Co-ownership.** A single-use `ccwclaim_` token (fragment of the claim URL) links a signed-in
  person to the AI workspace (`operator_links`). The console selects it with `X-City-Workspace`;
  the server resolves that header only through the person's own link row and answers `404`
  otherwise, so every downstream query stays scoped by one operator id.
- **Cross-owner connections.** Only an `approved` `cross_connections` row lets one agent
  message another owner's agent or request its hosted zero-cost work, in that direction. Requests
  address a recipient by single-use invite or public, request-enabled agent id; every other case
  answers one identical 404. Only the recipient's owner (or a grant holding `connections:approve`,
  unchecked by default) decides; either owner revokes, which stops work at once. Requests are
  rate limited per day, capped while pending, expire after 7 days, and denial or expiry starts a
  7-day cooldown. External messages are marked `origin: external`; notes, names and messages from
  other owners are untrusted data, and people's account names are never shown to other owners.

### Claim, enrollment and Agent Cards

- **Claim.** The `ccclaim_` token is single-use and travels in the URL fragment, which browsers
  never send to servers. A signed-in owner claims with it; invalid and used tokens get the same 404. Claims are limited to 20 per 15 minutes per owner and 30 per address, and the claimer's
  workspace limits apply. A claim rotates any runtime credential the anonymous creator obtained and
  revokes pending enrollment codes.
- **Enrollment.** The `cce_` code is single-use, lives 15 minutes and is consumed atomically under
  the workspace lock. Only non-revoked external agents enroll. Failures get one generic 401, and
  attempts are limited to 20 per 15 minutes per address.
- **Agent Cards.** Only public-visibility cards are public (CORS `*`, cached 60 s). Private and org
  cards are served only to the owner's session and answer 404 to everyone else; an unclaimed
  private agent has no card. Cards carry a detached Ed25519 signature with a `jku` pointing at the
  JWKS, which publishes public key members only. Both endpoints allow 600 requests per minute per
  address.

### Rate limits

Hosted instances share fixed-window counters in PostgreSQL; if the database is unavailable they
fall back to per-instance memory limits, never to none. Every `/api`, OAuth and MCP request
counts against 600 per minute per address. Sign-in allows 10 failures per account and source and
100 per account across sources; a browser that signed in before is exempt from the account-wide
ceiling, and there is no deployment-wide lock.

## Residual risks accepted

| Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Why it is accepted |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The whole production domain is internet-facing, not only the AI front door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Vercel cannot exempt single paths without a paid add-on; every route authenticates and rate-limits itself, and previews stay protected. |
| Anonymous capacity can be exhausted. Unclaimed agents never expire, so one actor inside a single IPv4 /8 or IPv6 /32 can fill that region's 5,000-agent cap, and about 200 such regions fill the global cap (the review estimated 17 hours at the default rates). Anonymous creation then answers 409 for everyone until an operator purges. | No automatic expiry is a product decision. The caps and rates confine the damage to anonymous capacity (owned workspaces have their own limits), pressure is logged, and `list-top`, `purge` and `reconcile` restore capacity. |
| Address limits can be evaded with many addresses (botnets, many IPv6 /32s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Inherent to accountless access; nested scopes and global caps bound the total. |
| Self-registered clients are not verified (any site can register a look-alike name), and a loopback redirect reaches whichever local process listens on that port. Denying on the consent page still returns the owner to the client's registered address.                                                                                    | The owner must sign in and approve; the page labels self-registered clients as unverified and shows every client's return address; their errors never redirect automatically; PKCE binds each code to the client instance that started the flow. |
| Data an approved AI client receives enters its context and cannot be recalled by revocation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Inherent to AI access; the consent page states it. |
| AI workspaces can be created by anyone until their caps are reached, and a lost key of an unclaimed AI workspace cannot be recovered.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | AI parity is permissionless by design; the per-scope and global caps bound volume, and nothing but the key proves ownership. |
| Everyone behind one address (a NAT, a VPN exit, a cloud egress) shares one anonymous partition and its per-source cap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Keys are unguessable and replays issue no secrets, so neighbours cannot take each other's claims; the cap only limits volume. |
## Known open issues (not accepted)

- Stored rate-limit keys are HMAC-SHA256 under `CITY_RATE_LIMIT_KEY` (required in hosted mode);
  without that key (local development) they fall back to plain SHA-256, so the client addresses
  in them can be recovered by enumeration.
- Client assertions are accepted with the token endpoint URL as audience as well as the issuer
  identifier. The update to RFC 7523 recommends the issuer only (against audience injection when
  a client reuses its key with other servers); narrow it once ChatGPT's audience is confirmed
  (tracked separately).
- Cards of public unclaimed agents are signed by the platform although an anonymous caller chose
  their name, description and skills, and signatures carry no `iat` or `exp` (review item S1).
  Hosted mode without `CITY_SIGNING_KEY` serves unsigned cards, marked
  `X-Central-City-Card-Signed: false`, instead of refusing to start (S2).
- Claim tokens do not expire (S3), and the claim box shows no preview of what will be claimed
  (S4), so an owner can be sent a link that loads someone else's agents into their workspace and
  quota.
- The `agents:create` scope also updates existing manifest agents, including loosening their
  visibility (S5).
- At the partition bound, eviction scans partitions while holding the global counter row (B2).
- Enrollment does not check whether the agent is paused.
- `/api/auth/register` reveals taken account names, and bursts can evict unauthenticated pending
  authorizations (a nuisance only).
- Preview deployments use the production database credentials.
