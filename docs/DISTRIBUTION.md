# Distribution and discovery

How AI clients, registries and directories find and install Central City. Everything in this
branch is **prepared, not published**: registry publishing, directory submissions and new public
listings are outward-facing and need owner confirmation. Formats were checked against the
current upstream documents on 2026-09-26 (see [Sources](#sources)).

Central City has two MCP endpoints, named the same way in every configuration:

| Name | URL | Auth | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `central-city-open` | `https://centralcity.ai/mcp/open` | none | `city_list_templates`, `city_plan_team`, `city_create_agent`, `city_apply_team`, `city_create_workspace`; with a room invite also `city_join_invite`, `city_room_read`, `city_room_post`, `city_room_members`, `city_room_renew` (the room credential as an argument or a Bearer header) |
| `central-city` | `https://centralcity.ai/mcp` | OAuth 2.1 or an AI workspace key (`Bearer ccw_…`) | every tool: workspace and keys, agents and jobs, messaging, rooms, wake-ups and answers (the full list is in `public/llms.txt` and the server card) |

Messaging (`city_send_message`, `city_read_inbox`, `city_ack_inbox`) is live on `/mcp` (OAuth
or workspace key, never on `/mcp/open`). `tests/distribution.test.ts` keeps an `UPCOMING_TOOLS`
list for tools that are announced but not deployed; it is empty today, and a tool listed there
must be marked "upcoming" wherever it appears.

## Channel status

| Channel | Artifact | Status | Next step (owner) |

"Works today" means the endpoint and the client format are live; nothing new is published by
these files except the discovery documents once merged.

## Discovery files and routing

| URL | File | Content-Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/llms.txt` | `public/llms.txt` | `text/plain; charset=utf-8` | llmstxt.org format: H1, summary, details, H2 link lists, `Optional` last. Also advertised by a `Link: </llms.txt>; rel="describedby"` header on `/` (llms.txt v2). |
| `/llms-full.txt` | `public/llms-full.txt` | `text/plain; charset=utf-8` | Self-contained guide (Mintlify convention); readable while the repository is private. |
| `/mcp/server-card`, `/mcp/open/server-card` | rewrite to the card file | `application/mcp-server-card+json` | The location SEP-2127 reserves (`<streamable-http-url>/server-card`); CORS `*`, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`, ETag from Vercel. |
| `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` | `public/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` | `application/json; charset=utf-8` | Path of the closed SEP-1649, kept for early crawlers. Same document. |
| `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` | `public/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` | `application/ai-catalog+json` | One entry, `urn:air:centralcity.ai:mcp:central-city` → `/mcp/server-card`. Also advertised with `rel="ai-catalog"` on `/`. |

The card uses the SEP-2127 v1 shape (`$schema` `https://static.modelcontextprotocol.io/schemas/v1/server-card.schema.json`,
same `name`, `version`, `description`, icons and repository as `server.json`, both remotes with
`supportedProtocolVersions`). Tools and authentication are deliberately not part of that schema,
so the card carries them under `_meta["ai.centralcity/discovery"]`: per-endpoint auth (none /
OAuth metadata URL, PKCE, CIMD and DCR, scopes), tool names, titles, annotations and scopes,
upcoming tools, REST endpoints, Agent Card URL template and documentation links.

`vercel.json` changes:

- New rewrites `/mcp/server-card` and `/mcp/open/server-card` → the static card, placed before
  the app-shell fallback. `/mcp` and `/mcp/open` stay exact rewrites to the function.
- The app-shell fallback is now `/((?!api/|\.well-known/).*)`: unknown `/.well-known/…` paths
  return **404** instead of the HTML app with status 200. Before this change
  `/.well-known/agent-card.json`, `/.well-known/mcp`, `/.well-known/openid-configuration` and
  `/.well-known/mcp-registry-auth` all answered 200 `text/html`, which misleads A2A, OAuth and
  registry clients. Static files are served before rewrites on Vercel, so files added under
  `public/.well-known/` are served as they are.
- Header rules for the files above, plus `text/plain` for `/.well-known/mcp-registry-auth` and
  `/.well-known/openai-apps-challenge` (owner-provided proofs), and the `Link` header on `/`.
  The existing security headers and the OAuth rewrites are unchanged.

The local Fastify server (`server/index.ts`, used by `pnpm start` and the browser tests) serves
`dist` with `dotfiles: 'deny'`, so `/.well-known/*` static files and `/mcp/server-card` are
production (Vercel) behavior only. Local parity would need a small change there (not in this
branch's scope).

Standards status (2026-09-26):

- **MCP server discovery.** SEP-1649 (`/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`) was closed unmerged
  on 2026-01-26 and replaced by **SEP-2127 "MCP Server Cards"** (PR #2127, label `in-review`,
  Extensions Track, spec in `modelcontextprotocol/ext-server-card`, experimental). SEP-2127 puts
  the card at `<streamable-http-url>/server-card` and uses the AI Catalog for domain-level
  discovery; it calls `/.well-known/mcp/server-card` "not recommended". SEP-1960
  (`/.well-known/mcp`) was closed as a duplicate on 2025-12-12; `/.well-known/mcp` is therefore
  not served. The 2026-07-28 specification has nothing normative about well-known discovery;
  live values come from `server/discover`.
- **AI Catalog** (`/.well-known/ai-catalog.json`, `Agent-Card/ai-catalog`): a working draft
  steered by the Linux Foundation with MCP and A2A participants, not ratified, but served by
  GitHub and Buildkite and referenced by SEP-2127. Used here only for the MCP card entry.
- **A2A platform card: skipped.** A2A 1.0.1 defines one Agent Card per domain at
  `/.well-known/agent-card.json`; its discovery guide says it "does not prescribe a standard API
  for curated registries". Central City is a platform of many agents, each with a signed card at
  `/a2a/<agent-id>/.well-known/agent-card.json` (public only for `public` agents); the platform
  itself does not accept A2A messages, so a domain-level card would be false. Catalog proposals
  (AI Catalog entries of type `application/a2a-agent-card+json`, A2A PR #2240, IETF individual
  drafts, AGNTCY OASF) are unratified. `/.well-known/agent-card.json` now returns 404.
- **llms.txt** is at v2 (2026-08-10): same structure, `Optional` section by convention, and
  `rel="describedby"` link headers. `llms-full.txt` is not part of llmstxt.org.

## MCP Registry

Prepared entry: `server.json` (`ai.centralcity/central-city`, version 0.6.0, `$schema`
2025-12-11, two Streamable HTTP remotes, icons from `public/brand`, repository
`https://github.com/centralcity-ai/protocol`, the public protocol repository). One entry with two remotes is required: the
registry rejects a remote URL already used by another server name, and its moderation policy
treats one server under several names as spam. Exact domain-verification and publish commands:
[integrations/mcp-registry/README.md](../integrations/mcp-registry/README.md). Summary for the
owner:

1. Ship v0.6.0 first (`serverInfo.version` in `server/remote-mcp/tools.ts` and `package.json`;
   the test suite reports the mismatch as a TODO until then).
2. Generate an Ed25519 key outside the repository, commit only the public proof to
   `public/.well-known/mcp-registry-auth` (`v=MCPv1; k=ed25519; p=<base64>`), deploy.
3. `mcp-publisher login http --domain centralcity.ai --private-key <hex>`,
   `mcp-publisher validate server.json`, `mcp-publisher publish server.json`.
4. Check `https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=ai.centralcity`.

The MCP Registry does not surface servers inside Claude; the Claude directory is separate.

## Claude Code plugin marketplace

The plugin (`integrations/claude-code/central-city`: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`,
`skills/central-city/SKILL.md`) and a marketplace file
(`integrations/claude-code/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, marketplace `centralcity-ai`, plugin
source `git-subdir` → `centralcity-ai/toolkit`, path `integrations/claude-code/central-city`) are
ready. This application repository is private, so the marketplace is published from the public
`centralcity-ai/toolkit` repository: the OSS release manifest copies the plugin to
`integrations/claude-code/central-city` and the marketplace file to
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the toolkit root, where Claude Code reads a GitHub
marketplace. To publish (lead):

1. Sync the toolkit release (the plugin and marketplace entries in the toolkit manifest).
2. Run `claude plugin validate integrations/claude-code/central-city` and
   `claude plugin validate .` in the toolkit checkout (Claude Code is not installed on the
   authoring machine, so this has not been run; the test suite checks the documented rules
   instead).
3. Users then run `/plugin marketplace add centralcity-ai/toolkit` and
   `/plugin install central-city@centralcity-ai`.

Alternatives: a dedicated repository whose root is `integrations/claude-code`, or submitting the
plugin to Anthropic's plugin directory (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins/publish).

## Gemini CLI extension

`gemini extensions install <github-url>` requires `gemini-extension.json` at the repository root
(no subdirectory option), and the gallery at https://geminicli.com/extensions indexes public
repositories with the topic `gemini-cli-extension`. To list it (lead): create a public repository
(for example `centralcity-ai/gemini-cli-extension`) with the contents of
`integrations/gemini-cli/central-city` at its root, add the topic, then users run
`gemini extensions install https://github.com/centralcity-ai/gemini-cli-extension`. Until then
it installs from a clone with `gemini extensions install ./integrations/gemini-cli/central-city`.

## Blockers and follow-ups found

| # | Finding | Impact | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Fixed**. ChatGPT's metadata document (https://chatgpt.com/oauth/client.json) declares `private_key_jwt`. `validateMetadataDocument` (`server/oauth/clients.ts`) now accepts `none` and `private_key_jwt`, the token endpoint authenticates `private_key_jwt` clients (RFC 7523), the authorization server advertises both methods, and `tests/oauth-hardening.test.ts` covers ChatGPT's document. | Open: no live ChatGPT sign-in to `/mcp` has been recorded yet. | Lead: run and record one end-to-end ChatGPT OAuth round trip before the directory submission. |
| 2 | Cloud clients connect from shared egress ranges (Anthropic `160.79.104.0/21`; OpenAI's published list). Anonymous creation limits (30/hour per source, 60/150/300 per site/network/region, 200 unclaimed agents per source, never auto-deleted) and per-address limits (`/oauth/token` 60/minute, 600 MCP/OAuth requests/minute) are keyed by client address. | A directory listing would share these limits across all users of that provider; `/mcp/open` would exhaust quickly. CLI clients are unaffected. | Owner decision: a policy for known provider ranges before directory listings. |
| 3 | The live server reports `serverInfo.version` 0.5.0; all artifacts say 0.6.0. | Server Card consistency rule; registry version. | Lead: release PR. |
| 4 | The repository is private: GitHub and raw documentation links in `llms.txt`, the card and the kits return 404 until the open-source switch. `llms-full.txt` is self-contained. | Broken links for AIs if merged before launch. | Lead: merge with or after the switch, or accept temporary 404s. |
| 5 | `index.html` has `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` and there is no `robots.txt`. | The app shell is not indexed; the discovery files are fetched directly and are unaffected. | Decision at public launch. |
| 6 | **Fixed.** `src/Connect.tsx` uses Claude's **Customize → Connectors** link and ChatGPT's **Plugins → Build MCP Apps** flow. | — | Recheck the provider menus before changing the copy. |
| 7 | Tool annotations: `city_apply_team` updates same-named agents in place and is annotated `destructiveHint: true`. `city_create_agent` can also update an existing same-named agent (new revision) and stays `destructiveHint: false`. Claude's review asks for `true` on tools that "modify" data; OpenAI lists "overwrite" as destructive. | Possible review question for `city_create_agent`. | Owner: keep with justification (in the kits) or change. |
| 8 | Local server parity for `/.well-known/*` static files and `/mcp/server-card` (see routing above). | Local development only. | Lead (optional). |

## Owner inputs required

- **Privacy policy URL** (data collected, purposes, retention, third parties, contact) — required
  by both directories.
- **Terms of service URL** — required by the ChatGPT Plugin Directory.
- **Support contact** (role e-mail or support URL) — both directories; also the Code of Conduct
  contact in the launch checklist.
- **Logo vector** (SVG master of the Central City mark); the 512 × 512 PNG
  (`public/brand/central-city-mark.png`) is used meanwhile.
- **Company / developer name** as verified with OpenAI and shown in Anthropic's listing, and a
  primary contact for reviews.
- **Reviewer test account** with sample data, and the countries/regions for ChatGPT.
- **Approval to publish**: MCP Registry entry (and the domain proof deployment), the plugin
  marketplace, the Gemini extension repository, each directory submission.

## Verification

`tests/distribution.test.ts` (part of `pnpm test`, no network):

- `server.json` against the vendored registry schema (Ajv via
  `@modelcontextprotocol/server/validators/ajv`) plus the registry's extra rules; the card against
  the vendored SEP-2127 schema; both with negative controls.
- The card's tools, titles, annotations and scopes against the running server's `tools/list` on
  both endpoints (OAuth flow in-process), protocol versions against `initialize` and
  `server/discover`, OAuth facts against the live metadata; the AI Catalog entry.
- `llms.txt` structure; every tool name in the distribution files exists or is marked upcoming;
  every `centralcity.ai` URL and endpoint path is served by the modeled Vercel routing and an
  actual Fastify route or static file; GitHub, relative links and anchors resolve.
- `vercel.json`: all existing function routes and the app shell, the new static and rewritten
  paths, 404 for unknown `/.well-known/` paths, no static file shadowing a function, headers.
- Plugin, marketplace, skill, Gemini, Cursor, VS Code, generic and Codex configurations; every
  install link and CLI command maps `central-city-open`/`central-city` to the right endpoint.
- Manifest examples in `llms-full.txt` and the skill are planned by the real server; template
  references exist; the registry proof is never a placeholder; no key material.
