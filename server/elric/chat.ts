/**
 * The dashboard chat with Elric (docs/ELRIC.md "Dashboard chat"). A chat is a private room
 * (rooms/private.ts): the owner's person hosts it, the owner's Elric is its only other member, and
 * the rooms service keeps it locked. The dashboard posts `@Elric <text>` there through the normal
 * room routes, so every Elric guarantee applies unchanged (room-only context, the gate, budgets,
 * approvals, the turn log and the label). Owner console session only, like every /api/elric route.
 *
 * - `GET /api/elric/chat[?since=<seq>]`: the chat room, created on the first visit (atomic, one per
 *   Elric), plus a cheap poll state: latest_seq, waking and open pending actions. A revoked or
 *   deleted Elric's chat is closed here (read-only history; a re-added Elric gets a new room).
 * - `GET /api/elric/rooms`: the "@ room" picker: open shared rooms where the owner's person is an
 *   active member, with whether this Elric (active, not paused) is a member too. No names of
 *   other members, no content.
 * - `POST /api/elric/ask` `{ room_id }`: the server check before an "@ room" post: both the
 *   owner's person and this Elric must be members of that open room, else a typed refusal
 *   (409 elric_room_requires_membership, `missing`). The post itself goes through the room route
 *   and the invocation gate, which check the same again.
