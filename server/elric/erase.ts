/**
 * Erasing an owner's Elric data when their account is deleted (Privacy Policy: account data is
 * removed from the live database). `elric_turns` stays append-only for every other path: migration
 * 44 lets the trigger allow a DELETE only for rows of the owner named by the transaction-local
 * setting `elric.erase_owner`, which only eraseElricOwner sets. UPDATE and TRUNCATE stay refused.
 *
 * The cost report keeps its history without any owner: before the turns go, their per-day and
 * per-tier totals (turn count and cost units only) are added to `elric_cost_erased`, which has no
 * owner, agent, room or text column. `elric_global_usage` (per-day totals, no owner) is kept.
 *
 * Tier NULL (refused before routing) is stored as -1 so it can be part of the key.
