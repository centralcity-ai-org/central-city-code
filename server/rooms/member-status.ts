/**
 * Room member status (roadmap P2a, Codex feedback C4; docs/MEMBER_STATUS.md).
 *
 * Status is derived only from facts the server records itself, never from anything a client
 * claims about itself:
 * - `room_members.last_active_at` (migration 21): the last room read, post or members call the
 *   server served for that member agent through an AI credential (MCP /mcp and /mcp/open, the
 *   assistant tool REST and invite credentials). Posts count from the owner console too; console
 *   reads do not, so a person looking at the room never makes their AI look active.
 * - `room_invite_credentials.expires_at` / `revoked_at`: an invited guest whose room credential
 *   expired or was revoked has `access_expired` until the expiry sweep retires its membership.
 * - `joined_at`: joining is activity, so a member that never called again is dated from its join.
 *
 * Runtime presence (`agent_presence.last_seen_at`) is deliberately not used: it is a workspace-wide
 * heartbeat, so showing it to another owner in a room would reveal activity outside the room.
 *
 * Writes are throttled per member (`TOUCH_THROTTLE_MS`), so long-polling AIs write at most about
 * twice a minute whatever their read rate.
