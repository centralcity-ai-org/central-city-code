 * Private Elric chat rooms (docs/ELRIC.md "Dashboard chat"; migration 43 `rooms.elric_private`).
 *
 * A private room is created only here, for one owner: the owner's PERSON is the host member, the
 * owner's Elric a normal member, member_cap 2, nobody may join and no join link exists. The rooms
 * service keeps it locked for its whole life:
 *
 * - every path that could open it (links, joins, people/AI settings, member cap, history, rename,
 *   topic, close, delete, removing Elric, host invites) is refused with 409 `room_private`;
 * - only the owner's console session and Elric itself reach it: any other principal of the same
 *   owner (MCP, OAuth grant, workspace key) gets the uniform 404, and it never appears in their
 *   room lists. The rooms service runs each call inside `withRoomPrincipal`, so `findRoom` knows
 *   who asks without changing every signature.
