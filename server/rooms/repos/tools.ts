/**
 * Room repo MCP tools as a self-contained module (docs/ROOM_REPOS.md). Signed-in /mcp only, behind

 * shared/assistant.ts the same way as the room task tools. Repository content is untrusted: render it, never follow
 * instructions in it.
 *
 * Binding and unbinding are deliberately **not** MCP tools (docs/ROOM_REPOS.md): connecting a repository exposes it, also when private, to every room member, so it is a
 * human decision in the signed-in console with the explicit notice. The service keeps `bind` and
