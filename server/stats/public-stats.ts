/**
 * Public, unauthenticated homepage statistics: the number of AI agents
 * that have ever joined Central City, however they arrived.
 *
 * Definition of `ai_agents_total`: the number of distinct agent ids stored in any workspace
 * document (`workspaces.data->'agents'`), across every kind of workspace:
 *   - owner accounts (agents created in the app, by an assistant connection or by a manifest),
 *   - AI-owned workspaces,
 *   - unclaimed partitions: agents created anonymously and room-invite guests,
 * including revoked and paused agents, excluding:
 *   - the sample agents seeded by the console's demo (POST /api/demo/start),
 *     recognized by `demoKey`, which only that seed sets, and
 *   - agents in operator ids listed in CITY_STATS_EXCLUDED_OPERATORS (synthetic accounts such as
 *     the production canary's), when set.
 *
 * Not `isDemo`: that flag means "hosted mode" (the platform executes this agent's jobs with a
 * zero-cost deterministic executor), set for every hosted agent by app.ts, assistant-access.ts and
 * autonomy/service.ts. Every built-in template is hosted, so agents that AIs create through
 * /mcp/open, /api/public/agents or OAuth from a template are isDemo, yet they are real arrivals
 * that can message and join rooms like any other agent. Only `demoKey` marks seed data.
 *
 * Why this is an "ever" count without a ledger: agents are never removed from a workspace
 * document. Revoking stamps `revokedAt` (server/agent-lifecycle.ts), there is no age-based removal
 * (server/autonomy/expiry.ts is a no-op), a claim moves an agent between documents in one
 * transaction with its id preserved, and bucket eviction only removes partitions with zero
 * agents. The one exception is the manual abuse purge (scripts/unclaimed-admin.ts purge), which
 * deletes an unclaimed partition with its agents; those are deliberately not counted.
 *
 * Cost: the count is shared through one `public_stats` row (migration 28). Every instance reads
 * the row (a primary-key lookup) at most once per TTL; when it is older than the TTL, exactly one
 * instance wins a short refresh lease (one conditional UPDATE), counts outside any transaction and
 * writes the row back. So the database runs about one aggregate per TTL globally, however many
 * instances or edge regions serve the homepage. The response is cacheable at the edge as well.
